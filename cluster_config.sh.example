# The installer automatically uploads the RHCOS image to glance.
# While this allows to ensure the right image is used, this also means you'll
# need to transfer 2GB both ways when deploying a cluster which may not be the
# most convenient for development. You can set the following variable to point
# to an existing image to skip this step:
# export OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_OS_IMAGE_OVERRIDE="rhcos-4.6"
